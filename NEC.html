								<h2><b>Project Intern experiance at NEC</b></h2>
								<p>During my tenure at NEC Technologies, I had the privilege of working on a cutting-edge research project titled "Integrity Protection for CAN Messages in Connected Car Systems". This opportunity came after leveraging my extensive subject knowledge and the curiosity to explore new domains, which proved instrumental in acing the interview.</p>
								<p>Assigned as the sole contributor to this project, I demonstrated the ability to work autonomously, delving deep into the realms of 5G Technology, CAN-Bus communication, automotive security, and embedded system security. This culminated in the development of a comprehensive paper presenting the application of various cryptographic techniques in ensuring the integrity of CAN messages in connected cars.</p>
								<p>The dedication and innovation I brought to this project were met with commendation from the Assistant Vice President at NEC. This validation reinforced my belief in the power of individual initiative and the capacity to drive significant contributions within a team.</p>	
								<p>In recognition of my achievements, I was awarded a stipend of INR 15,000 upon the successful completion of the project, underscoring the value I added to the organization. Furthermore, I chose to present the same project as my final year endeavor in college, earning an accolade that marked a unique distinction. I stand proud as the only individual in the entire college who undertook and completed this project independently, thereby bringing immense honor to the institution.</p>
								<p>This experience not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a sense of self-reliance and an unyielding commitment to delivering excellence in every endeavor. It stands as a testament to my capacity to excel in challenging, research-intensive environments and my dedication to driving innovation in the field of automotive security.</p>
