								<h2><b>My Journey as a student at UTD</b></h2>
								<p>I am currently pursuing higher education at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), a renowned institution known for its excellence in academics and cutting-edge programs. Here, I undertook the prestigious Masters in Business Analytics program, which stands as the largest program of its kind in the United States, encompassing a comprehensive 36-credit curriculum.</p>
								<p>During my time at UTD, I delved into a diverse range of courses that not only broadened my understanding but also equipped me with practical skills crucial for the field of Business Analytics. Some of the standout courses I engaged in include:</p>	
								<p><ul>
									<li>Business Analytics with R </li>
									<li>Database Foundations for Business Analytics</li>
									<li>Advanced Statistics for Data Science</li>
									<li>Professional Development</li>
									<li>Big Data</li>
									<li>Cloud Computing Fundamentals</li>
									<li>Applied Machine Learning</li>
									<li>Prescriptive Analytics</li>
									<li>Econometrics and Time Series Analysis</li>
									<li>Data Visualization</li>
									<li>Marketing Web Analytics</li>
									<li>Predictive Analytics using SAS</li>
									<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
								</ul></p>
								<p>UTD not only provided a rigorous academic environment but also served as a platform to apply the knowledge I gained into real-world applications, solidifying my grasp on the subject matter.</p>
								<p>In addition to my studies, I also took on the role of a Graduate Teaching Assistant, contributing to the undergraduate course 'Information Technology for Business'. This invaluable experience not only honed my teaching abilities but also sharpened my own skills.</p>
								<p>Beyond academics, I immersed myself in various extracurricular activities. Holding the position of Associate Vice President at the Society of Operations Research and Management Sciences (INFORMS) Club at UTD, I spearheaded a dedicated events team responsible for organizing presentations, event planning, execution, and overseeing logistical aspects. This role also involved active participation in club meetings, as well as managing room bookings.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, I had the privilege of being a part of the esteemed Business Analytics Leadership Council. As a member of the mentoring team, I extended guidance to both current and incoming MSBA students, offering insights and assistance through the mentorship program, drawing from my own experience</p>
								<p>Overall, my journey at UTD has been nothing short of remarkable. I am set to graduate in Spring 2024 (May 2024), and I am eager to channel the wealth of knowledge and skills I've acquired into meaningful contributions in the field of Business Analytics.</p>
