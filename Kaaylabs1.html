								<h2><b>My Journey in the Field of AI</b></h2>
								<p>Upon joining Kaay Labs Inc., I embraced the opportunity to apply my skills in AI and Data Science to tackle complex problems, working on cutting-edge technologies in the AI domain. In my current role, I have been actively involved in designing and deploying AI models, working with advanced techniques such as Langchain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and continually innovating to provide value to customers.</p>
                                <P><b>Accomplishments:</b></P>
                                <P><ul><li>Designed and implemented AI models using Langchain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to develop a highly responsive and accurate QA chatbot, customized to meet the unique requirements of customers.</li>
                                    <li>Migrated the AI model to Graph RAG techniques by building a comprehensive knowledge base using Neo4j, significantly enhancing data interrelation, improving model accuracy, and increasing contextual relevance for more precise results.</li>
                                    <li>Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract state-related information from AI responses, developing an interactive choropleth map to visualize and analyze the extracted data, which resulted in higher user engagement and deeper insights.</li>
                                    <li>Implemented GitHub Actions to automate CI/CD workflows, streamlining the build, test, and deployment processes, which led to a reduction in manual intervention and increased efficiency across the development cycle.</li>
                                    <li>Managed all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from gathering requirements and designing solutions to deploying and maintaining systems, ensuring seamless execution of projects with timely and quality outcomes.</li></ul></P>
                                <p>This role has allowed me to continuously grow as a data-driven professional, honing my expertise in AI model design, data visualization, and automation processes. I remain dedicated to leveraging my technical skills to innovate and drive impactful solutions, helping Kaay Labs Inc. stay at the forefront of AI advancements.</p>
